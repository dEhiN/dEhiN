  <b>🎈 About Me:</b>
  <br>
  <em>
    I'm currently in the field of SaaS client support but want to pivot into software development, with possibly a focus on automation or web development. I studied Computer Science at university at the start of the 2000s but stepped away from the field for about 12-14 years. In 2019 I started taking some online courses to relearn programming. When the pandemic hit, I put the courses on pause to get into IT support as it was a quicker route at the time. I then moved into SaaS client support. I continue to take courses and practice my programming skills with the hope to either pivot fully into a software developer or engineer type of role or to incorporate my programming and analytic skills into my current field, possibly in a technical analyst role.

    Please note that I have at least a beginner level knowledge in or familiarity with all the languages and libraries/programs listed below. Some I've learned from online courses I've taken while others are from use in current or previous jobs (see my LinkedIn profile for more information). Python and PowerShell I've used the most, so my knowledge is past beginner.
