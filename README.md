👋 Hi, I’m @dEhiN

👀 I’m interested in software development, IT support, IT automation, and possibly DevOps

🎈 About Me:
I'm currently in the field of IT support but want to pivot into software development, with possibly a focus on automation or web development. I studied Computer Science at university at the start of the 2000s but stepped away from the field for about 12-14 years. In 2019 I started taking some Udemy courses to relearn programming. When the pandemic hit, I put the courses on pause to get into IT support as it was a quicker route at the time. I continue to take courses and practice my programming skills with the hope to either pivot fully into a software developer or engineer type of role, or to incorporate my programming and analytic skills into my current field, possibly pivoting into more of a technical analyst role. In the next section, please note that all the languages and libraries/programs listed I have a beginner knowledge in and familiarity with. Some are from online courses I've taken while others are from use in current or previous jobs (see my LinkedIn profile for more information).
